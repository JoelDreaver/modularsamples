A pair of virtual Instruments based on the Roland System 100, Oberheim Xpander and Korg Volca Keys construction kits. Both instruments share the same sample library but have very different layouts and functionality.

Created with [HISE](http://hise.audio). An open source framework for sample based instruments.
