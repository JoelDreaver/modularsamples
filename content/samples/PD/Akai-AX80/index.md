Title: Akai AX-80
summary: EXS24, Kontakt & SFZ. 2.5gb
---

The Akai AX-80 is an aggressive sounding CEM based polysynth from the early 80s. It sounds decent and looks super cool with it's vacuum florescent display and big chunky knob. With 2 oscillators, 4 LFOs and 2 envelopes it is a pretty flexible keyboard.

This is a reasonably large collection of over 30 patches with some tasty oscillator sync sounds.
