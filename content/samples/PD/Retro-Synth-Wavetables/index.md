summary: A large collection of sounds for Retro Synth
Title: Wavetables for Retro Synth

---

## 337 wavetables and counting..

This collection distills the wider Modular Samples library into a bunch of wavetables, patches and Smart Control Panels for Logic's Retro Synth instrument.

Recently updated with over 20 new wavetables, new patches and better organisation.

## **Installation:**

Copy the contents of each folder to the corresponding folder found in Music/Audio Music Apps/

Please note that by installing this collection you will loose any 3rd party or self created wavetables. This is because logic only allows 1 user wavetable file (RetroSynthWavetable.plist)

## **Usage:**

**Patches:** Load an instance of RetroSynth in Logic and select a patch from the Library window.

**Channel Strip presets:** Create a new track and select a preset from the Channel settings menu.

**Track stacks:** Create a new summing stack from the Tracks menu, then, from the library panel select a stack preset.

**Note:** Both channel & stack presets feature a Smart control panel that you may find useful.
