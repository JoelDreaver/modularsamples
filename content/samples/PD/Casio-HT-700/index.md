Title: Casio HT-700

---


The Casio HT-700 is definately the best thing I've bought for under Â£20. Sure, the keyboard's broken and patches don't survive the dodgy power cable getting uplugged but it's just packed with charming features like multi-timbrality, crunchy drums and analog fulters, goofy waveforms..
