Title: Casio HT-700

**A Poem about the Casio HT-700:**

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways. I love thee for thy tasty waveforms and crunchy drums.

My soul can reach, when feeling your alpha wheel. For the ends of envelopes and ideal 2 digit display. I love thee to the level of every day's Most quiet output, by paraphonic VCF and auto-accompaniment.

I love thee freely, as play a chord with a single finger. I love thee purely, as thy don't sync well to MIDI. I love thee with the passion of a nerd. In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.

I love thee with a love I seemed to lose. With my lost Juno. I love thee with the external sequencer, FX Pedal, tears, of all my life; and, if God choose,

I shall but love thee better after death
