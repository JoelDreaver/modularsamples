Title: Behringer Crave
---

If the Behringer Crave has taught me one thing it is this; Moog's semi-modular desktop boxes are much more interesting than first impressions would suggest. As a copy (clone. Knock off, whatever)  the Crave is functionally identical to the Mother 32. This is a good thing because Moog know how to design synthesizers.
