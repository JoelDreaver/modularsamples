Here's one for the sound designers, tweakers and other assorted types. A truly humungous collection of waveforms from a diverse range of electronic musical instruments including the Casio HT-700, Eurorack modular, Korg DSS1, Novation Bassstation II & more.  

The idea is to use the sounds as the basic building blocks for sample based synthesis, each waveform has been multi-sampled and has typically 8 or more velocity layers allowing for very detailed patches.  

For a rough idea where I'm going with this see the public domain construction kits of the Xpander, Juno and System 100.
