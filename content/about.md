I started this website in 2010 to host a small collection of samples I had created using a Eurorack modular synthesizer, since then things have gotten a bit out of hand, there are now over 250 Gigabytes of content , covering a diverse range of synths from the Roland Jupiter 4 to the Oberheim Xpander.

My goal has always been to recreate the original sound as closely as possible. To this end I tend to sample each note of the synthesizer and use a limited amount of additional processing. Of course this isn’t always sucessful, but sometimes, if you close your eyes and play a few notes, you might be able to imagine you’re playing the original machine.

Most of the sample content on this site is licensed as Public Domain, this means you are free to use it in any way you like, from use in your musical compositions to modification and redistribution.

If you enjoy the samples and find them useful please consider becoming a Patreon sponsor, or buying one of out fine products.
